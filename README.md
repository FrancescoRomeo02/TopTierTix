# TopTierTix

TopTierTix is a React web application designed for scanning QR codes at private events.

## Description

This web app allows you to scan QR codes generated from user data collected through a Google Form, initially stored in a Google Spreadsheet, and later transformed into an online database. The QR codes are generated by a Python script and sent to you via a Telegram Bot specifically created for this purpose.

## Notes

- The integration between the spreadsheet, database, Python script, and Telegram bot was implemented online using [pipedream.com].
- The usage of this app is restricted to me. If you attempt to replicate this project, you will not have access to personal information or anything beyond the React code used to develop the web app.

## What I Learned

- **React**: I gained proficiency in creating a small React project, installing and utilizing new dependencies, and creating components and hooks.
- **User Input Cleaning**: I learned how to effectively manage user information, extracting only the pertinent data from form submissions.
- **Project Integration**: I mastered the art of merging various projects (database systems, Python scripts, React web apps) into a unified, cohesive project.
- **Telegram Bot**: I successfully created my first Telegram bot, enabling communication regarding new event subscriptions.
- **Database**: I honed my skills in SQL and database management.
- **API Integration**: I worked with APIs to enhance the functionality of my application.
- **Hosting**: I deployed the website using Vercel.
